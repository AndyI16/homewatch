This EEWE issue (152) [http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=152&q=eewe] has been around for a while and was originally reported in 2009.  Within the source file ATmegaBOOT_168.c, around line 584, we will comment out the old and add in the new:

// ?kraz? -fixed EEWE bit definition missing in versions 1.6.7 and newer of the file /avr/eeprom.h
// According to this issue reported in 2009: http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=152&q=eewe
#if defined(EEPE)
                while(bit_is_set(EECR,EEPE));           //Wait for previous EEPROM writes to complete
#else
                while(bit_is_set(EECR,EEWE));           //Wait for previous EEPROM writes to complete
#endif
 
/*
#if defined(__AVR_ATmega1280__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega1281__)
                while(bit_is_set(EECR,EEPE));           //Wait for previous EEPROM writes to complete
#else
                while(bit_is_set(EECR,EEWE));           //Wait for previous EEPROM writes to complete
#endif
*/

hjgode: the above EWEE fix is also needed wwhen using a 644 based board like the sanguino or AVR-NETINO (Pollin AVR NetIO within Arduino).
